# Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning

This report presents the development of a decision tree regressionmodel for predicting housing prices using a dataset of real estateattributes. The dataset, named "USA_Housing.csv," includes featuressuch as average area income, house age, number of rooms, numberof bedrooms, and population density, along with the correspondinghousing prices. The objective of this study is to construct a decisiontree regression model without using built-in functions, relying solely onmanual implementation.The process involved loading the dataset, defining independent anddependent variables, and implementing key components of thedecision tree algorithm, including node representation, splittingcriteria, tree construction, and prediction. The implementation wasperformed in Python programming language using libraries such aspandas, numpy, and matplotlib.Upon constructing the decision tree, predictions were made on thedataset, and evaluation metrics were calculated. The Mean AbsolutePercentage Error (MAPE) was used as the primary evaluation metricto assess the model's performance in predicting housing prices.Additionally, visualizations were created to depict the actual versuspredicted prices and the percentage error.The results indicate that the decision tree regression model achieveda MAPE of [insert MAPE value here], indicating an averagepercentage error in predicting housing prices. While the modelprovides insights into the relationship between real estate attributesand prices, further refinement and optimization may be necessary toimprove its predictive accuracy.Overall, this report demonstrates the manual implementation of adecision tree regression model for housing price prediction andhighlights the importance of understanding and customizing machinelearning algorithms for specific datasets and objectives.
